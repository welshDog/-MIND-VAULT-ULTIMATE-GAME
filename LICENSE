## Special Accessibility Commitment

This project is specifically designed to celebrate and support neurodivergent
minds, particularly those with ADHD and dyslexia. We are committed to:

1. **Maintaining zero text dependency** - All gameplay must remain accessible
   without reading requirements

2. **Preserving visual-spatial focus** - Core mechanics must continue to 
   leverage neurodivergent cognitive strengths

3. **Open accessibility standards** - Modifications should enhance rather than
   reduce accessibility features

4. **Community-driven development** - Major changes should involve input from
   the neurodivergent gaming community

## Attribution

While not legally required, we encourage attribution that recognizes this
project's neurodivergent-first design philosophy:

"Built with Hyperfocus Zone - celebrating neurodivergent visual-spatial intelligence"

## Research and Educational Use

This software and its accessibility innovations are freely available for:
- Academic research into neurodivergent gaming
- Educational tool development for visual-spatial learning
- Accessibility standard development and testing
- Therapeutic application research (with appropriate oversight)

We encourage researchers to share findings with the neurodivergent community
and contribute improvements back to this open-source project.

## Commercial Use Guidelines

Commercial derivatives are permitted under MIT terms, with strong encouragement to:
- Maintain accessibility features in any commercial products
- Consider revenue sharing with neurodivergent advocacy organizations
- Acknowledge the open-source accessibility innovations in marketing
- Contribute accessibility improvements back to the community

## Community Values

Users of this software are encouraged to uphold our community values:
- Neurodiversity celebration over deficit-focused thinking  
- Accessibility-first design in all derivatives
- Inclusive language and respectful communication
- Scientific backing for accessibility claims
- Community collaboration over individual profit
